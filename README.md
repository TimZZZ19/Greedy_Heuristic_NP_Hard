# Greedy_Heuristic_NP_Hard
This project was from CS430 Introduction to Algorithm. It was all about implementing a greedy heuristic algorithm on a NP hard problem where a bunch of points, given their x and y coordinates, needed to be separated by vertical and horizontal lines. The big challenge here was that the amount of those lines must be minimized.
The project was a lot of fun!
