# Greedy_Heuristic_NP_Hard
<p>This project was from CS430 Introduction to Algorithm. It was all about implementing a greedy heuristic algorithm on a NP hard problem where a bunch of points, given their x and y coordinates, needed to be separated by vertical and horizontal lines. The big challenge here was that the amount of those lines must be minimized.</p>

<p>The project was a lot of fun! I had to do a lot of reading about the algorithm and grasp the essential idea to be able apply it to solve the problem. As time goes by, eventually I will forget most part of the algorithm, the problem and extacly what I did back then, but I will remember how I was working under a lot of pressure and a severe deadline and how I just really buckled down, read the paragraph relating to the topic in the book, kept asking my professor and TA questions, kept trying and lastly came to the point where I finally cracked the problem. I will remember that after sitting for the entire day in front of my computer and finally got to see the startling and exciting results, I sat up, went out and just walked in the park near my aparment, round after round just to clear my mind, immensing myself in the great sense of achievement of having just accomplished something so challenging, and I will remember that feeling forever, because it's why I got into coding.</p>
